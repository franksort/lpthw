I looked at some code on GitHub.  Mainly shovel by seomoz.

Some thoughts:

The Python ecosystem seems to copy the Ruby ecosystem, despite having
been around longer.  In this case shovel is a port of Rake, 
which I think is a common tool used by Railers.

A lot of programming involves cruft.  Paths, dates, cramming
data into arrays and getting it back out.  There's also the
software engineering necessary to get things running.  That involves
installing the right software, keeping it up to date, finding and
learning how to use the right modules, version control, and 
environment control.  It can be tiring and not very 
intellectually stimulating.

But if after all that, you solve a problem or make something that 
someone uses, it feels pretty good.
