Using a integer vs. a floating point number for
space_in_a_car only matters in the following line:
carpool_capacity = cars_driven * space_in_a_car

cars_driven is an integer.  When space_in_a_car is
an integer, carpool_capacity contains an integer.  When
space_in_a_car is a float, carpool_capacity is a float.

In this particular case, using a float vs. an int has no
effect on the result since the operation involves
the  multiplication of whole numbers.
