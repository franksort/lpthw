# Concatenating variables together with the plus operator then printing.
# I don't understand how the comma is able to alter the way print operates

# watch that comma at the end.  try removing it to see what happens
# without the comma, the strings are printed on seperate lines
# with the comma the strings are printed on the same line but 
# with a space between them
